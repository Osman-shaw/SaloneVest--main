# SaloneVest Anchor Hand-off Package

Contents:
- `templates/` — Anchor program source (`lib.rs`, `Anchor.toml`, tests, deploy script)
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` — Windows PowerShell installation steps for Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor
- `prepare_handoff.ps1` — PowerShell helper to recreate the ZIP and inspect contents

Quick instructions for a Solana developer:
1. Install prerequisites (Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor). See `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`.
2. Initialize an Anchor workspace (or use the existing templates):
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\repo\anchor
   anchor init investment-escrow
   # Replace generated program files with the contents of `templates/` or move templates into the workspace
   ```
3. Build and test:
   ```powershell
   anchor build
   anchor test
   ```
4. Deploy:
   ```powershell
   anchor deploy
   ```
5. After deploy, copy IDL and types to frontend and update environment variables as noted in `deploy.sh`.

Notes:
- The tests in `templates/investment_escrow.ts` mint an SPL token (USDC-like) and run locally against a local validator or devnet. Running tests requires `node`, `yarn` (or npm), and a working anchor/solana install.
- Program ID placeholders are present; `deploy.sh` automates replacing them after a successful build/deploy.

Contact / Handoff checklist:
- Ensure the developer has deploy keypair and access to the Solana cluster you intend to use (devnet or mainnet).
- Recommend running in a `devnet` or local validator first.
