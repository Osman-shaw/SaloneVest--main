# IDL Directory

This directory will contain the Interface Definition Language (IDL) files generated by Anchor after building the smart contract.

## What is an IDL?

The IDL is a JSON file that describes the structure of your Solana program:
- Instructions (functions)
- Accounts (data structures)
- Types (custom data types)
- Events

## How to populate this directory

After building your Anchor program:

```bash
cd anchor
anchor build
```

Copy the generated IDL file:

```bash
cp target/idl/investment_escrow.json ../frontend/lib/idl/
```

## Usage

The IDL is imported in `lib/anchor-client.ts` to create a typed client for interacting with the smart contract.
